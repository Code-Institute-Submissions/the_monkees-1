    Project Title:
    
        The Monkees band website
    
    
    Project purpose:
    
        This project is designed to showcase a fontend static
        website using only HTML and CSS(no javascript).
        
        The websites main purpose was to inform Fans both new and old about the music that 
        The Monkees had to offer. Giving the user the oportunity to listen to Audio or watch video,
        with the option of purchasing back catalogue music. Incorperating as many social media sites 
        so that fans can be kept up to date on all news and activities of the band. The 
        option of booking the band for your own personal occasion is also included in this site.
    
    
    Tech/Libraries:
    
        For this project I designed a wireframe mockup using pen and paper of how the site would
        function and how a user would interact with it.
        
        I used bootstrap as a framework in order to give structure to the layout.
        I also used font awesome libraries in order to display fonts to advertise social media sites
        
    Testing:
    
        mobile/destop:
        
        For this project I used chrome DevTools in order to see how each page was displaying on different devices from desktop
        all the way down to smartphone. DevTools was particularily useful for seeing changes in real time.
    
    
    code resourses used:
    
        I referenced w3schools(https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) in order to get code syntax correct
        and bootstrap documentation(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) for layout
    
    
    sites that inspired me:
    
        For my booking form I took inspiration from a mountain bike website that I use.
        I like the style of the form and based my design on it but all of the code is my own work.
