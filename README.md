    ###Project Title:
    
        The Monkees band website
    
    
    Project purpose:
    
        This project is designed to showcase a fontend static
        website using only HTML and CSS(no javascript).
        
        The websites main purpose was to inform Fans both new and old about the music that 
        The Monkees had to offer. Giving the user the oportunity to listen to Audio or watch video,
        with the option of purchasing back catalogue music. Incorperating as many social media sites 
        so that fans can be kept up to date on all news and activities of the band. The 
        option of booking the band for your own personal occasion is also included in this site.
    
    
    Tech/Framework:
    
        For this project I designed a wireframe mockup using pen and paper of how the site would
        function and how a user would interact with it.
        
        I used bootstrap as a framework in order to give structure to the layout.
        I also used font awesome libraries in order to display fonts to advertise social media sites
    
    
    Technical difficulties:
    
        My biggest challenge was to make thie website as responsive as possible. I struggled in 
        this area but and pleased with the final result although the desktop version has suffered
        in order to prioritise the mobile compatability. The different phone screens were tricky to
        setup. I found that the Ipad and Ipad pro were the easiest to design for.
        
        Also my contact page opns my Gmail on my Phone and creates a new message but on my computer its does not open as i do not have a local outlook(thunderbird in my case) set up.
    
    code resourses used:
    
        I referenced w3schools(https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) in order to get code syntax correct
        and bootstrap documentation(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) for layout
    
    
    sites that inspired me:
    
        For my booking form I took inspiration from a mountain bike website that I use.
        I like the style of the form and based my design on it but all of the code is my own work.
